This is the culmination of all we did in CS320. Includes JUnit tests and Acessment on the process.

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

**How do I approach designing software?**

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

My code was written according to best practices. I wrote small sections and then tested as I went to ensure that my code was technically sound. My code will be reusable for several other projects in the future. I wrote my code to be efficient by using a minimalist design, indented so my code is easy to read. Lastly, my code was commented so that any other programmer in the future will understand what is going on in the code. 

 Researching usersâ€™ needs is best. Make your decisions based on data.  Think of what would be advantageous to the user. Forsee patterns and behaviours of projects and user inputs of the past or similiar projects. Whenever possible get instant feedback from users, so that you can incorporate their needs into the program ensuring the best quality you can deliver.
